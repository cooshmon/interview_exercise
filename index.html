            objects for his entire life. Just like the rest of us, he places the sugar
            jar next to the coffee machine. However, he also makes sculptures that
            interfere with the order of things. Here, he talks about why his objects
            are not “readymades” with Anthony Huberman, from The Artist’s Institute,
            which is dedicating its current season to Steinbach.

      <div class="hs">HAIM STEINBACH: What is a “readymade”?</div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        ANTHONY HUBERMAN: I suppose the historical definition of the readymade
        is an object that an artist did not make, that an artist picks, finds,
        or chooses, and inserts into a context that frames it as art, without
        doing anything to it. And then that notion has become much more
        complicated and layered over the years.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">HS: Must the artist present it as art?</div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: Well, no. I think it is mostly the act of placement into an art
        context that plays the role of framing something as art. I don’t think
        the artist names it anything. It’s the context that does the naming, not
        the artist.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: Duchamp, with his “readymades,” was engaging with, prodding, the
        museum system. The way he is usually discussed is misleading. He said he
        was “indifferent,” but his indifference had to do with distancing—with
        his ability to step outside the usual structures of aesthetics and say
        that anything could be aesthetic. If anything can be aesthetic, then you
        can go to the department store and buy a bottle rack or a urinal, sign
        it “R. Mutt,” and present it to a museum as a work of art by Mutt.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: So with that in mind, I’d like to try and apply those ideas to your
        own work. I think one way people understand your work is as a Duchampian
        gesture, or that the objects on your shelves operate like readymades. I
        want to try and talk about that, and perhaps challenge it a bit. For
        example, tying into this idea of indifference, I wanted to ask you about
        the relationship your objects have to the idea of the home. As opposed
        to the Duchampian conceptual gesture of going into a shop and buying
        something, the objects in your work have spent time in someone’s home,
        in someone’s life. Is this something you think distances your work from
        the lineage of the readymade?
      </div>
      <div class="hs">HS: Well, Duchamp’s objects also spent time in his life and home.</div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: Right, but he didn’t buy the bicycle because he wanted to use it as
        that. He put it in his studio to figure out what the hell to do with
        this shape, this form.
      </div>
   
      <div class="hs">
        HS: I don’t know, did he not ride a bicycle? Duchamp stated that he made
        Bicycle Wheel to entertain himself. He said that whenever he was bored,
        he would just turn the wheel. That he would do this for his amusement
        contradicts the idea of his total indifference, and again points to how
        much it has to do with pleasure and amusement. By bringing the bicycle
        and/or a bicycle wheel inside the house to play with, he domesticated
        it, which then brings in a social dynamic. I would say that my practice
        is directly connected to the social. It embraces the idea that art is
        always with us, a function of the everyday. Singing a song while ironing
        a shirt, or speaking theatrically, which we all do now and then—all of
        these activities are an extension of our social lives, our civilized
        existence. With my work, the bottom line is that any time you set an
        object next to another object you’re involved in a communicative, social
        activity.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>

      <div class="ah">
        AH: Because your works have more than one object? Or are you referring
        to the act of displaying them?
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: There’s always more than one object at hand. Being here means you
        and here. Anything is always nearby or next to something else. It is
        always part of the collectivity, part of the fluidity of existence and
        communication within a socialized, cultural society. My practice is to
        try to point to things that we ignore out of habit. One of the realities
        of the everyday is that we ignore everything that is part of the
        everyday. As long as something is in the right place, we are
        comfortable, and we can ignore it. Now the question is why is it in the
        right place, why are we comfortable with it, and why do we ignore it? If
        the order of things gets disturbed, it gets our attention. I like to say
        that I aim to interfere with the order of things. My goal is to find
        other ways of ordering things.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: We tend to think of a readymade as a single object, and therefore
        your idea of an object being in a community of objects falls slightly
        outside of the Duchampian tradition.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: I’ve been criticized for exactly that. I’ve been accused of
        betraying Duchamp.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">AH: Betraying him? Is that what you think you are doing?</div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: At this point the “readymade” is an ideological term. When Duchamp
        called his work a “readymade,” he meant that it was something that was
        already made, something of function that was industrially mass produced
        that he didn’t make himself. It already existed in the world, an object
        among objects. There was nothing more remarkable about it than that. If
        anything, he reminded us that the bottle rack was as remarkable as the
        Mona Lisa. He was breaking hierarchies of aesthetic judgment. It was an
        assault on the establishment, all the values of Art. He was opening the
        gates of vision by saying that vision is selective, a politically
        structured hierarchy. Even by the time Duchamp died in 1968, the urinal
        was still considered kind of a joke. But then, once Duchamp was
        canonized, he became a God like Marx, Einstein, and Freud, or any
        radical visionary. His work was studied, and he was taken very
        seriously. The “readymade” had to be defined and validated within the
        historical hierarchy.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">AH: And so it lost its punch as an attack on aesthetic judgments.</div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: It was assimilated, and yet in the museum it still causes friction.
        Unless it’s put in the design department. My work returns to questions
        of hierarchies, but in a completely different way. Whereas Duchamp
        selected objects from the hardware store, I am accused of embracing all
        the objects in the world.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: Let’s talk about that. “Choice” is the operative word in thinking
        about both your work and the readymade. One does not make something, but
        rather chooses something.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: Objects are part of language, just as words are. The question is
        what do you construct with them. Objects are more than words because
        they are more specific and completely embodied, with structures of
        representation, style, form and culture. An object is really the
        embodiment of a world. If each object is a world in itself, then can you
        construct a meaningful message or story with a group of objects.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: And the idea of placing objects in a row on shelves came out of that
        line of thought?
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: Yes, on a very basic level, this is what I set out to do in the
        mid-1970s. By the end of the 1970s I was doing display installations in
        which I was arranging objects in a normative way. I was not gluing them
        together. I was not adding paint. I placed them on shelves, like words
        in a sentence or notes in a musical score. The language of placement,
        the language of arrangement. Once you question what you do with objects,
        you are of course looking once again at the social structures of putting
        objects to use in the home, in the bathroom and the kitchen, and so on.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: It also brings in performance, the idea that these objects are being
        “put into play,” as you have said. In the same way that Roland Barthes,
        at this same time, was talking about a sentence as words being put into
        play. This is distinct from the notion of the readymade, which is about
        an object inhabiting a context, rather than an object or objects being
        asked to enact, or perform a series of actions next to each other.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: Duchamp put the bottle rack or coat hanger into play. He took a coat
        hanger and put it on the floor, and called it Trap. There’s a poetic
        language game happening, a pun, and it’s meaningful because he is
        asserting his idea over the object by turning it into something other
        than its intended function. He was the author of that object in a new
        way. The argument for the “readymade” as a distinctive, meaningful
        artistic gesture has to do with the notion that it’s not about the
        object per se, but the concept. What is often being said about my work
        is that if anything can go with anything, and all objects are equal,
        then the work lacks an idea, however my ideas are not the same as
        Duchamp’s. While I order the objects in repetition and singularity, I
        basically present them and their meanings remain open ended. And that’s
        unsettling to many, but there’s friction, sound, and resonance in play
        below the surface.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: You’re asking an object to have authority on its neighbor, and vice
        versa.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: It’s giving the object its own voice. When you take a urinal, sign
        it “R. Mutt,” and call it Fountain, you are putting the aura of your
        authority, and the aura of art, on it. This is also true for the bottle
        rack, which no longer is as such, as it is now a “readymade.” Whereas
        when I present something, it is placed in common manner, implying to be
        interacted with by the receiver.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: You seem to be talking about the difference between representation
        and presentation. One way to think about the readymade in the Duchampian
        tradition is that it’s a representational act, it means more than what’s
        in front of you. In your case, the objects are not representing the
        authoritative, artistic genius of an artist, but they are objects
        presenting themselves to us. </div>
        <div class="hs">HS: The term “readymade” to me is now a
        hierarchical term, giving everyone who participates in the discussion
        the idea that they are a part of something very special. It has entered
        the realm of elitism. I’m saying, my work is not a “readymade.” I am not
        involved in “readymades,” my work is not about the “readymade.” I am
        playing and exploring with objects.</div><div class="empty"></div>
      
      <div class="ah">
        AH: So, if there was an object lying around the studio that you had
        actually made yourself, it would not be in any way more significant, and
        you might choose it in the same way that you would choose an industrial
        object?
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: It is a question of what does it mean that you make an object or
        don’t make an object. Who makes the object, who deserves the credit for
        making the object? And what is making anyway? Isn’t thinking, imagining,
        and conceiving a way of making? When a musician composes a score, who
        makes the music, the composer or the orchestra? I have an intimate
        relationship with all the objects I work with, just as any creative
        person has an intimate relationship with their material, whether they
        are a musician, a poet, or a writer. Most of the objects that end up in
        my work have been with me at least half a year if not longer. I’ve had
        objects that have been sitting around for decades that ended up in a
        piece many years later. Sometimes they have personal histories, and
        sometimes they don’t, it’s not necessarily something that somebody gave
        me; I could have gotten it for myself, but they’ve become part of my
        personal history, because they have been part of my space, part of my
        domestic reality.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: Going back to having authority or agency over objects, you already
        brought up how Duchamp would title his works as one way he exerted
        agency or control over them. Could you talk a bit about the way you
        think about titling?</div> <div class="hs">HS: Theoretically, titling is a very important
        aspect of my thinking. I would say that Duchamp’s convention of titling
        was very different. It’s an important distinction that you’re bringing
        up. There are several ways in which I title. One basic way is that the
        work is Untitled with the “U” capitalized. Then in parentheses I list
        the names of the objects, for instance Untitled (elephant, toilet brush,
        kong). The elephant is not really an elephant; it is a small, ceramic
        elephant. The toilet brush is made of plastic and doesn’t look like a
        toilet brush because it was designed to look like a Brancusi sculpture.
        For many years MoMA used to sell it in their bookstore. And the Kong is
        actually a rubber dog chew, but it’s also the name given by the
        individual who designed it. So, I’m pointing out that the names by which
        we identify objects are bound in language. A ceramic elephant is not an
        elephant, and the word elephant is not an elephant. When my son, River,
        was a year and a half old, he called the elephant he saw on TV, “Omni.”
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">AH: But some of the titles are much more abstract or poetic.</div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: Another way I title works is to give them a found word, or a found
        statement. I keep a list of ones I run across, so I’ll remember them
        later.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: So if there are three objects on a shelf, this “found phrase” of the
        title becomes a fourth object?
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: Exactly. The title itself is a found object like the other objects.
        The question is then how to take those parts and arrange them.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: Like making a song? With repetition, and rhythm. Here enters the
        idea of composition.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">HS: Well, “composition” is OK but I prefer the word “arrangement.”</div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: There is something more “democratic” about an act of arrangement
        over one of composition. Perhaps this goes back once again to our
        discussion of the notion of authority? It’s interesting that although
        the readymade is often considered to be connected to indifference, that
        it’s actually imbued with huge amounts of authority, whereas the way you
        relate to objects tries to attack that notion of authority.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: Yes, because it takes it out of the realm of absolute specificity
        and total power of the originator, and throws it more to the world of
        the relativity of objects and contexts. I think the ideology of the
        “readymade” at this point transcends any notion of arrangement. It has
        become a symbol, almost a religious symbol. </div><div class="empty"></div>
        <div class="ah">AH: You talk about turning
        power over to objects, but at the same time, you do place them in very
        specific order or a very specific arrangement. What if someone decided
        to switch their order? What if a collector who owned one of your works
        decided to change the placement?
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: My work is indeed vulnerable in that way. It always is vulnerable to
        that joke: “You can move it, it doesn’t matter.” Of course it matters to
        me, but of course it also doesn’t matter. Once somebody owns my work,
        they might decide to play with it. They may also have to dust it, or
        they may choose to dust one object but leave the others alone for the
        next year, and see what that looks like. Somebody might take the ashtray
        off the shelf and put a cigarette in it, and the owner may become
        incensed or may simply put it back on the shelf and offer another
        ashtray to the guest.
      </div><div class="empty"></div>
      <div class="ah">
        AH: But all that matters to you, right? It changes the song, so to
        speak.
      </div>
      <div class="hs">
        HS: Right, and it extends the discourse from something that Duchamp
        started. It is coming out of that history. With all due respect, Duchamp
        did something very radical that affected many of us. He opened doors to
        discussion, and vast areas to develop, in terms of how we relate to
        objects and what we prioritize, and give special attention to, and see.
        It really opened the doors of seeing. In art, ultimately, who has the
        control on what we see and how we see?
